<p>
My name is Alexander Tompkins. In 1993, I was born in the Florida Hospital in Orlando. My mom is South Korean, and my dad Hispanic. My biological dad left when I was still very young, either 1 or 2., so I never really knew him. From there, I lived a modest childhood. My mom was working all the time, so I mostly stayed with my grandmother, who frankly, spoiled me rotten. I was allowed to eat basically whatever I wanted or asked for, and spent a lot of my free time playing video games on the computer.</p>

<p>
Around the time I started to hit the teenage years, it slowly started to become clear to me that my lifestyle was beginning to become a problem. 
I loved gaming, and I still really do, but I was spending so much time on the computer that it could definitely be considered unhealthy, even for a young teenage kid without any real responsibilities. On top of that, 
I wasn't paying attention to what I was eating or making any real effort to eat healthy whatsoever, 
and I've never really had a strong metabolism. Because of this, I became fat, and peaked at a weight of around 225 at a height of 5'9. I knew I was unhealthy, and I wanted to change it, but I was so enveloped in my current lifestyle that I felt like I had no control over it. It wasn't until well after high school was over that I looked into the mirror and truly admitted to myself that things needed to change if I cared about being happy in my life, 
and from that point on I've made an extremely strong effort to not only get into shape, but to make sure I stay in shape. 
To this day, getting into shape and shedding all those pounds is one of the hardest things I've ever done, but also the single most important thing that I've done for myself in my life up to this point. Nowadays, although I still spend a lot of my time on the computer and playing video games, 
I am truly happy and also make sure I keep a balance in my life and try my hardest to live a healthy lifestyle.</p><br><br>

<h2>Hurricane</h2></a>
<span>By: Halsey</span>
<p>
Halsey was born and raised in New Jersey as Ashley Frangipane. She is of Italian, Hungarian, and Irish descent on her mother's side and African-American on her father's. Growing up, Halsey played the violin, viola, and cello until moving onto the acoustic guitar when she was 14. In one of her first interviews, Halsey stated she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around the age of 16 or 17. When she was 18, Halsey encountered financial trouble and music became a way to pay her rent. She played numerous acoustic shows in different cities under various stage names. She chose "Halsey" as her moniker because it is an anagram of her real name as well as a street in Brooklyn where she spent a lot of time as a teenager. Halsey originally planned on going to college to major in fine arts but instead enrolled in a community college as a creative writing major after realizing she could not afford it.
</p>
<p>
Hurricane is one of my favorite songs by Halsey. She spoke about the song and it's meaning in an interview, and what she said was: "It's about a girl that kinda like falls for this guy who is gonna make things hard on her and is gonna take advantage of her, but she kinda ends up turning it around in the end and she says: 'I'm a wanderess. I'm a one night stand. Don't belong to no city. Don't belong to no man.' So it's kinda like her response to him, saying like you know, you can think you got me all you want, but I don't belong to anyone but me."

"And umm you know I talk about Brooklyn, Brooklyn's my place. That's where Halsey comes from, Hurricane is a very special song to me and I love it."
